## 🔍 The Vision

In an era of information warfare, "Fake News" is rarely 100% false. It is often constructed with "9 truths and 1 critical lie." Traditional scoring systems fail because they average out the toxicity. 

**Digital Detective** implements the **Sewage Theory**: Just as a single drop of sewage ruins a bottle of fine wine, a single fabricated expert or a major logical fallacy invalidates an entire narrative. We don't calculate averages; we look for **Red Flags**.

## 🛠 Methodology

### 1. The Tri-Lens Protocol
Every narrative is atomized into testable **Claims** and passed through three simultaneous filters:
*   **Source Lens (Origin)**: Deep-dive into mentioned entities. Do they exist? Are they authoritative or fabricated?
*   **Fact Lens (Evidence)**: Real-time verification against current web data using Google Search grounding.
*   **Logic Lens (Structure)**: Identifying emotional manipulation and structural fallacies (e.g., Slippery Slope, Ad Hominem).

### 2. S.C.A.N. Framework (AI Co-Pilot)
A strategy for Human-AI collaboration:
*   **S**ummarize Claims: Extract the core architecture of the narrative.
*   **C**heck Fallacies: Use LLMs to find structural weaknesses in reasoning.
*   **A**nalyze Sources: Cross-reference identities across the web.
*   **N**eutralize Tone: Rewrite text to remove emotional bias and reveal the raw data.

## ✨ Killer Features

*   **🕵️‍♂️ Dossier-Style UI**: Immersive "Intelligence Agency" interface where results are presented as classified evidence files.
*   **🌐 Real-time Grounding**: Automatic **Source Trail** generation with clickable web references and favicon identification.
*   **🎙️ Live Scan (Voice Intelligence)**: Real-time voice analysis. Speak a claim or read an article aloud, and the terminal will debunk it via audio in real-time using Gemini Live.
*   **🚩 Red Flag Verdict**: Immediate visual "Detective Stamps" (AUTHENTIC vs FRAUDULENT) that reflect the Sewage Theory logic.
